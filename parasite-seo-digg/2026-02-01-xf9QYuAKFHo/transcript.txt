Last night was a Friday night, and I was up until 3 a.m. But I wasn't partying, I wasn't out, I wasn't doing any shenanigans—well, I guess I kind of was doing some shenanigans. I was at my computer doing Dig SEO, that is right, Dig, the precursor to Reddit. Booking usernames, completely common usernames that were not claimed. Creating—I don't even know what they're called—communities, that's what they're called on Dig, it's the equivalent to a subreddit on Reddit. Look, if you don't know, Reddit can rank for, like, anything on Google. You can create a post, a comment, a thread, whatever, on Reddit, where you take your keyword, you put it at the beginning of your Reddit post, at the beginning of your Reddit comment, and there's a good chance that it's going to show up on Google for that keyword. So Jackie Chu, who has been on the show twice before now, friend of the podcast, he posted this on X last night, and I saw it, and I—it was—I saw it at 2 a.m. and I'm like, this is—this feels like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I need to capitalize on this. So Jackie said, "Repeat after me: Dig is the new Reddit in 2026. It is already live, already trusted, and already indexable." For some background, this is a headline from Gizmodo, from January 15: "Dig relaunches from the grave with some AI enhancements." For all the people who have been abandoned or have been kicked off Reddit, your blue sky moment has arrived. So Dig has relaunched—Dig, which has a domain authority of 92—relaunched. And Jackie said de—domain rating, he's using domain rating, but he's saying domain rating, which is the equivalent of domain authority, of 90-plus domains do not just come back online every year, and he is correct. When they do, you abuse them immediately, or you miss the window. Most people will ignore this until it's saturated. Dig checks every box: massive legacy trust, VC-backed resurrection, Reddit DNA without Reddit mods, crawlable indexable URLs, community-plus post structure, editable content. Google does not care that it is new again; Google cares that it is trusted. The Dig Parasite SEO SOP: step 1, lock in real estate immediately, then grab single-word usernames, niche communities, subreddits equivalent, generic URLs—example: dig.com/localseo—and a lot of crazy communities were unclaimed and still are unclaimed. You can go create. People took SEO already, of course, and local SEO, but there are so many—like, let me see, how about Pokémon cards? dig.com/pokemoncards. Not taken. You could go and create that right now. If you wait—this is back to Jackie Chu—if you wait, you lose. Step 2: steal what already ranks. Go to Reddit, find a subreddit in your niche, export the top pages, the highest traffic URLs, proven titles. You are not inventing content; you are porting demand. Step 3: rebuild at scale. Use AI to recreate the top posts, deduplicate, keep intent identical, publish as Dig posts. Volume matters early; perfection does not. Step 4: force indexing. Copy the live Dig URLs, submit immediately to index checks. Indexing speed equals advantage. Day 1: indexing matters. There's lots of indexers, by the way, and they are black hat; you should not use them on your own domains. Or they're risky. It's hard for me to recommend using an indexer on a money site, but if you're using it on another site, well, that's a different story. If you're using it on, like, a big site with a ton of domain authority that's not going to be taken down by an indexer, that's a different story. And indexers are used very commonly with parasite SEO, but you still have to be careful. All right, so step 5: stack internal links. This is where it gets stupid. Link communities to each other, link posts to hubs, link hubs to money pages. Use about pages aggressively. Internal authority compounding on a domain rating 90-plus domain is illegal in spirit. Why this works: Dig already has historical trust, a clean link graph, crawl priority, engagement signals. You are not ranking Dig; you are borrowing Dig. What Dig will rank for? I really like that line, "You are not ranking Dig; you are borrowing Dig." What Dig will rank for? Best X. X alternatives, reviews, comparisons, buying intent keywords, AI tool lists, software roundups, same playbook, new host. What not to do: do not wait, do not ask permission, do not worry about monetization first, do not drip content, do not assume this lasts forever. Parasite windows close fast. Shout out again to Jackie Chu for sharing that. And I started playing around with this, and then I found—and I posted this, I posted this on X—I said, "Oh my God, Dig is giving follow links. This is a bloodbath. I just booked three popular usernames, none are taken, and created a community." Dig is giving follow links; they don't have no follow on the links. It is a brand new opportunity, and all of this will quickly get patched. Now, what I want to say is, if you go—I have to say this—if you are not careful, if you go too aggressive, there is a good chance that because Dig's moderation is so lacking, like, you can literally just go and post and post and post. You don't have to wait for any time in between posts like you do with Reddit. You can just go and post aggressively, post. You can share links aggressively, post, post, post. You can do all of that stuff. But if you go too aggressive—actually, you know what? Before I even give this warning, which is an important warning, Jackie Chu posted an update after sharing this. Jackie said, "The neckbeards have won, my post is removed, and I lost all my accounts." And he had a Dig page ranking on Google already: "Best Local SEO Software 2026 from Dig. What are the best local SEO software in 2026?" And I went to that, and it was taken down from Dig. And he said, "I have lost all my accounts." So when I was creating accounts, I was doing it with different IP addresses, using incognito windows. The thing is, okay, on Reddit probably wouldn't work; there's device fingerprinting. Like, Reddit's spam detection is very well built out. Dig's is not. It will get well built out; at the moment, it is not. So I created three different usernames on different IP addresses—actually, after recording this, I'm going to do a fourth—different IP addresses, posted, and I posted in a way where it doesn't look like I am just shilling very hard. You know, you're posting one thing that is a shill, but then the next thing you're contributing to a community, contributing to another community. And the reason why this is so important is with platforms where their moderation isn't super heavily built out, they are actually a lot less forgiving to spam because they're dealing with so much of it. And so it's possible that if they catch a spammer and they see that your URL is being spammed, they might just block it entirely from the platform. So you really have to be careful in a moment like this. These moments, they come and they go. The window, like Jackie said, does not last forever. But if you go too hard, if you are too aggressive, if you shill too much, if you spam too much, then, yeah, you could see your entire domain or brand name just blocked from the platform entirely. And that happens with Reddit. There's some words that you can't say on Reddit, some domains that you can't say on Reddit, or they're blocked from different communities. But yeah, that is important to keep in mind. I don't want anyone to get in trouble when I share this. The beauty with this is, look, with Reddit, even if you have a new account, you can't post right away. And a lot of the better subreddits have very sophisticated spam detection tools. Often they remove posts that aren't even spam. That's how aggressive their anti-spam efforts are. Reddit parasite SEO still works with more niche communities where the mods just aren't as aggressive, the mods aren't as aware. With Dig, there is none of that. There is none of that. That's why this is such a crazy opportunity, but you got to be careful. You know, like, don't create your accounts using the same IP address, for example. It's super easy to identify. The fact that Dig doesn't have any blockers with the velocity of posting, and you can post links, and they're using do-follow links that pass link juice, that says to me that their moderation efforts are still in the early stages. But yeah, I would still totally recommend just being careful. And I'm not going to say go slow, but don't make it obvious what you're doing. The other thing is, when you post, like Jackie said, you have to use an indexer. You can use something like Rapid URL Indexer, I believe Jackie suggested Index Checks. Yeah, Index Checks was the one that he recommended. Because if you are not driving clicks to it from somewhere, from somewhere outside of Dig, or I guess within Dig, but if you are not getting a lot of traffic to the page, Google might not know that it exists. Even though the domain authority is very high with Dig, you know, it just launched, Google hasn't been crawling it. So you need to give Google a reason to crawl the page. Anyway, this is crazy that this has happened. Like I said, I was up until 3 a.m. last night on Friday doing this because it's a fleeting opportunity. You can get the craziest usernames right now, create the craziest main communities. Like, if you're in local, you could probably just create a community in your city. I wonder if—I'm sure New York City is taken. Dig—because I'm from New York City—dig.com/newyork. There's no way it's not taken. Yeah, it's taken. Someone took it. Someone took it, and there is only one post on it. How about NYC? Come on, give me NYC. Nah, NYC is taken too. How about Brooklyn? Ah, it's taken too. Oh my gosh. But there's no post in it. That's how crazy this is. Okay, anyway, I'm done. I'm done. I'm so excited by this. And yeah, but be—like I said, please be careful. Jackie got clapped. He says it. All his accounts—he lost all of his accounts, and his posts were taken down. So be careful. Anyway, that is everything that I got for you on this episode of the show. This is a fleeting opportunity if you want to do SEO that just really lasts, that's super sustainable. That's what I built my SEO course around: compact keywords. It's a 13-and-a-half-hour course. If you don't know anything about SEO, it'll show you—it'll teach you search engine optimization that makes money really fast. It is a different type of search engine optimization: purchase intent search engine optimization, where you are targeting people who want to purchase now, who want to use something now, who want to make a discovery call now. If you are advanced in SEO—well, a lot of advanced people are still doing old techniques that don't work as well. Compact keywords is a new technique that works really well, and has been working really well, and will continue to work really well. The testimonials on the landing page say everything that I need to say. So if you just go to compactkeywords.com, watch the video testimonials, and the video at the top of the page, it'll give you everything. Can't recommend it enough. There's a reason that I spent a year building it. It is the best method of marketing, period. And that is at compactkeywords.com. That's all for the show. This is episode 928 of The Edward Show, 928 days in a row doing this podcast. If you watched this on YouTube, thank you so much for watching. If you listened on Spotify or Apple Podcasts, thank you so much for listening. And I will talk to you again tomorrow. Bye now.
