      "text": "Today I'm going to show you how to do Parasite AI SEO on Reddit. This is one of the strategies we use. You can see, for example, our subreddit here actually gets 70,000 views per month by creating content. This is not like spammy content; it's actually like content people enjoy reading. You can see here, for example, people commenting on it. We publish a lot of content. We've got 3,800 members, and we only started this a few months ago, this subreddit. I actually thought it was too late and wouldn't work, and then it began to take off. And now we basically just publish our videos, like you can see inside the channel here, and we also publish a lot of articles as well. So I'm going to show you how the process works and what we do, and how to do it step by step, and how to replicate this yourself in case you're interested in getting traffic. And the great thing about Reddit is it is free to use, right? You don't have to pay to use Reddit. Anyone can post on there. Anyone can start up their subreddit. And what I've actually done is, for the resources for this live stream, we've actually created a list of stuff that you can use to help you to generate this. And the main thing to note here is, like, Reddit SEO is really powerful because Google made a deal with Reddit, and now Reddit can rank really quickly on page one of Google and also AI search engines within 24 hours. Like, not weeks, not months, but hours. And I'll show you an example, right? So, for example, if we go over to Perplexity here, as you can see, and we'll just put something like Notebook AI, LMSEO, right, something like that, right? What you can see is it will actually source different sources around the web. And it will pull in, for example, like LinkedIn or, for example, YouTube and that sort of thing, right? And basically, what you can do is you can actually rank this content, not just inside Reddit, as you can see, but also inside AI search engines that people are searching via, right? So if you have a look at, for example, this keyword, you can see that my Reddit article from the subreddit is actually ranking inside Perplexity directly, and it's got links to all my funnels right at the top to convert that traffic, right? And you can see another example here. So this is the traffic for this website. We're using the same technique, but on the website, and it works. So even if you don't want to do it directly on Reddit, no problem. You can actually do it on a website, like you can see here. And the other thing you want to see here is, like, we're actually embedding a YouTube video at the top. We don't just rank directly inside Google. We don't just rank inside Perplexity and AI search engines, but we also rank directly on YouTube as well. And so you're 5xing your traffic at this point. And you see it's neatly formatted. The content reads really nicely. This article itself actually got 2,500 views directly on the platform, as you can see right there. So if we zoom in on that, there we go. All right. And then if we go on See More Insights as well, you can see how it's performing. So 2,500 views, a decent amount of those from the United States, a bunch of upvotes, etc. Six shares. Six people shared this content. And it's pretty simple and easy. You can actually see where it shared as well, which is interesting too. So I actually never look at those analytics, but I should pay more attention. The other cool thing here as well is we created that three months ago, but it's still ranking inside Perplexity, right? So that's the great thing about this is when you're doing this, like, you're creating content now, but it ranks this week inside Reddit. It could rank in three months' time inside AI search engines, and its reach just expands. You never get less views on a piece of content, of course, right? It only increases. And so you're creating these assets that can generate more traffic, more leads, more sales over the long term. So that's basically how it works. And so let me break down exactly how it goes. We've published over 300 posts. We get, like, thousands and thousands of visitors, and we use AI free tools, and you can automate this. And the great thing about this is you don't need to be technical. You don't need a website. You don't need any visitors. And Google is literally just giving Reddit posts page one rankings right now. It's absolutely insane. In fact, Reddit threads appear in 82% of Google searches on page one. I think most people don't realize that, but just read that again. Reddit threads appear in 82% of Google searches on page one. That is insane. And most people have no idea this is happening. So let me show you the system of how this works, right? And this is called the Goldie Reddit Parasite Engine. This is my personal framework for turning Reddit into a 3D generation machine, Reddit Parasite Engine. The difference between Reddit and why you should do it now is, like, Google signed a deal with Reddit. Actually, ChatGPT as well have leveraged this too. And so Google gets access to Reddit's content to train its AI models. So Reddit gets boosted in the search results. And the result is Reddit actually saw a 270% increase in ranking keywords. They added 110 million new keywords to their arsenal. And Reddit has a domain rating, a domain authority of 91. That's higher than Fortune 500 websites, right? So when you post on Reddit, you're borrowing their authority. Your post can rank faster than a brand new website ever could. I've tested it myself, and I've shown you the proof already that this works, right? That's basically how it goes. I've given you a bunch of prompts here, for example, but what you can actually do is you could use Claude to actually generate names for your subreddit. But the best, the first place to start is to really go to subreddits and create a new subreddit, like you can see here, right? So, for example, we created the AI SEO Insider, and that is a subreddit where we post all of our content, right? Now, from there, you want to pick a niche-specific name. So, for example, we've used AI SEO Insider. If you're in the e-commerce niche, you might use e-commerce growth hacks. If you are in the local business niche, you might use, like, local business AI, right? And you can actually use this prompt on Claude to come up with a bunch of names. From there, you want to start using the content engine. Now, you can use something like Claude. I would actually recommend Claude for creating content. All you would do, right, is you would plug in, like, a social media post or a video transcript, etc., into Claude, as you can see, and you just paste the content in right there. So, as an example of that, if I go over to YouTube here, and if I open this up, this YouTube video, and then we'll pull in the transcript from the page, all right, and then we'll take that, we'll go back to Reddit, paste in the content, and we'll see pasted content attached. We've taken the YouTube transcript, and now what we're actually going to do is get this to turn it into content for our subreddit. You would actually customize your subreddit right here, but you can see how you can easily generate, using that video transcript, an article based on that content. And because we're using our own content to generate the article, we're actually using that first-person perspective, right, because it's all trained on our case study data and everything else. And there you can see the article right there, right? And that's basically how it works. That's what we do. We rinse and repeat it. Sometimes we just post YouTube videos. Sometimes we post full articles, etc., but it is responsible for generating a large amount of traffic. We actually measured how many clicks we get from Reddit as well, and it's a decent percentage as well. And the other cool thing is, like, it actually compounds over time, right? So if you actually look at our traffic month by month, January, we didn't get anything. That's when we started. February, we barely got anything. It's a slow burner, right? It took a long time to start getting traction, but it compounds over time. And now you can see we're up to the point where we're just getting 70,000 views per month on this platform, and it works really well. We're at over a quarter million views this year, 3,800 members, etc., right? So if we have a look at the past three days, 70,000 views on that content, which is insane. That is insane, considering this is free. And so with a combination of your website, Reddit, you can use LinkedIn, etc., it's quite easy to start generating a lot of content and then also ranking it. And as long as you quality control it before you publish it, you're good to go. So if you want all the video notes from today, you can get that, including some example prompts and everything else. I've actually given you a 30-day plan to really follow this step by step. The main thing to note here is you're not spamming. You're not creating spammy content. You're creating quality content, checking it before you publish it, and then you can publish this and rank it across your own subreddit and then generate an asset that actually pulls in leads, pulls in new members, etc., right? And also giving you some ideas of, like, builds you could actually build. For example, like, you could actually get Claude to create, like, a visual dashboard of everything that you're doing today, along with a Claude Reddit response bot, right? See, for example, you could actually create something that monitors your subreddit, or you could just paste in the responses on the subreddit and get it to automatically answer community questions and that sort of thing, all right? The old way of getting traffic was, like, you would build a website from scratch, wait 12 months for Google to trust you, write, like, 100 blog posts manually, build backlinks one by one, compete against massive sites, pay for ads to get any attention, hire writers or spend hours creating content, and then hope Google doesn't penalize you. That was the old way of getting traffic, right? The new way with this Reddit method is, like, you can create a subreddit in 60 seconds. You borrow Reddit's authority, which is insanely high. You let Claude write all your content. You automate the posting with free tools. You rank within hours, not months. Zero ad spend required. No technical skills needed. And Google is literally pushing Reddit content to page one. 82% of all searches have a Reddit thread on the first page, right? And so this isn't about working harder. It's about working smarter and just using tools that exist right now that most people don't know about. I think that's the game in 2026, and the winners will use AI, and the losers will do everything manually. So the question is, which one are you? Now, let me break some limiting beliefs that might be holding you back, because I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking, \"I need to get a good writer to create content.\" Here's the thing, right? So if you look at, for example, like, Richard Branson, he's dyslexic. He can't write, right? But he's built a billion-dollar empire. And how has he done that? He surrounds himself with people and tools that do what he can't. And Claude actually writes better than most humans. It writes in your voice. It writes on any topic. It never gets writer's block. You don't need to be a good writer, essentially, right? You just need to be a good editor. Read what Claude creates. Fix what needs fixing. Publish it. Boom. You're done. And so the new empowering belief of SEO is really, \"I'm the creative director, and AI is my writing team.\" Other people would say, \"SEO takes too long. I don't have the patience for it.\" And I get it. Traditional SEO might take 6 to 12 months, and that's brutal. But Reddit Parasite SEO is pretty different. So I've ranked keywords in 24 hours, not 24 months. And why is that? It's because you're borrowing Reddit's authority. Google already trusts Reddit. So when you post, Google trusts you instantly. And this is the shortcut. This is the hack. This is what everyone's been waiting for. So the new empowering belief really is, like, \"I can rank fast by borrowing authority from platforms Google already trusts.\" And finally, like, people say Reddit is for nerds. Reddit is for memes, etc., and won't work for my business. Reddit actually has over 108 million daily active users, right? 2 billion monthly visits. There's a subreddit for literally everything, right? Real estate, B2B software, fitness coaching, digital marketing, whatever you do, right? Your customers are probably on Reddit right now, asking questions, looking for solutions. So you just need to be there. And bear in mind, you don't just get the traffic from Google and AI search engines. We also get the traffic directly from Reddit's platform, which is very powerful too. And so the new empowering belief really is, like, \"My ideal customers are already on Reddit. I just need to show up and help them, okay?\" So that's basically how it works. I've given you the 30-day plan, all the prompts, case studies showing and proving that it works, and you can see all the strategies that we've talked about today. Colin says, \"Happy New Year, brother. Thanks for the videos. Happy to help. Great to see you, and happy New Year.\" And essentially, that's how we get so much views in just 30 days using Reddit AI SEO. It's very powerful. Most people are not leveraging it properly. We're creating really good content. Myself and my team spend a lot of time creating this content, but with AI, we can really scale it, and we can really get good results from it, and that's what we're working towards.
