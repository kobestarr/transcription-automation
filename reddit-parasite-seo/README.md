# Reddit Parasite SEO Knowledge Base

## What is Reddit Parasite SEO?

Using Reddit's high domain authority (DA 91) to rank content in search engines. By creating subreddits and posting optimized content, you can capture search traffic without building your own website.

**Why Reddit:**
- DA 91 domain authority
- Free to use
- Reddit traffic = free traffic
- Community trust and engagement

## Key Concepts from Research

### 1. Subreddit Setup (CRITICAL STEP)

**Why it matters:**
- Your subreddit becomes your own micro-site on Reddit's DA 91 domain
- Name should be memorable and directly related to your offer
- Quick setup (1 minute)

**Step-by-Step Creation:**

1. **Go to Reddit** → Create Community
2. **Choose subreddit name** - Examples:
   - Selling AI services? → "AI SEO Insider", "AI Profit Boardroom"
   - Selling a course? → "[Course Name] Community"
   - General business? → "Business Growth Systems"
   
3. **Naming tips from research:**
   - Ask ChatGPT: "Give me 5 subreddit names for [your offer]"
   - Make it brandable and searchable
   - Avoid generic names that are taken
   
4. **Add details:**
   - Banner image
   - Topics/categories
   - Description (what the community is about)

5. **Example from research:**
   - Community: "AI SEO Insider"
   - Purpose: AI + SEO services
   - Result: 25K monthly visitors, 2,100 members, 300+ posts

**Best practices:**
- Name around what you SELL, not just your interest
- Make it searchable but unique
- Check availability before committing

### 2. Content Strategy
- Repurpose existing content (YouTube, blogs, tweets)
- Use Claude AI to generate articles from transcripts
- Quality control is CRITICAL (AI hallucinates)
- Embed YouTube videos for retargeting

### 3. The 4-Step Process
1. **Set up subreddit** - Name related to your offer
2. **Create content daily** - Use Claude, repurposed content
3. **Quality control** - Always review before posting
4. **Post consistently + measure** - Track views, optimize headlines

### 4. Headline Optimization (80/20 Rule)
- 80% of effort on headlines
- Better headlines = more views
- Use AI headline swipe files

### 5. Content Funneling
- Always include links to:
  - YouTube videos (retargeting)
  - Lead magnets
  - Free resources
  - Sales pages

### 6. Analytics

- Track engagement metrics
- Reddit views start immediately (vs SEO months)

## Tools & Automation

### Make.com Auto-Blogger
- Automates posting from spreadsheets
- Claude generates content → posts to Reddit
- Warning: Quality control needed for customer-facing content

### Proxies & VPNs
- Reddit can ban accounts
- Use residential proxies
- Build karma slowly on new accounts

### N8N vs Make.com
- Make.com simpler for Reddit automation
- N8N more complex but powerful
- Quality control easier with Make

## The Goldie Reddit Parasite Engine Framework

**From Video #2 - Key Framework:**

### Why NOW is the time:
1. Google signed deal with Reddit (2024)
2. ChatGPT also leverages Reddit content
3. Reddit DA 91 (higher than Fortune 500 sites)
4. You're borrowing Reddit's authority

### 4-Step Process (Refined):
1. **Create subreddit** (60 seconds) - Name around your offer
2. **Content engine** - Use Claude to repurpose YouTube/transcripts
3. **Quality control** - Review before publishing
4. **Post & compound** - Views increase over time

### Old vs New SEO:

| Old SEO | Reddit Parasite SEO |
|---------|---------------------|
| Build website (12 months) | Create subreddit (60 seconds) |
| Wait for Google trust | Borrow Reddit's DA 91 |
| Write 100 posts manually | Claude writes all content |
| Build backlinks one by one | Reddit already has authority |
| Pay for ads | Zero ad spend |
| Hire writers | AI does the work |
| 6-12 months for results | Rank in 24 hours |

### Limiting Beliefs to Drop:
- "I need a good writer" → "Claude is my writing team, I'm the editor"
- "SEO takes too long" → "Rank in 24 hours by borrowing authority"
- "Reddit is for nerds" → "108M daily users, 2B monthly visits"
